# Assignment

Write a function _matop()_ that computes the sum of the values of the principal diagonal a squared matrix of size N, which is provided as input to the function. If the output value is even, the function returns the maximum value of the input matrix. On the contrary, the function returns the minimum value.
2. Write the function _matop()_
3. Write a main function that initializes and prints the matrix before calling the function matop() and prints the result.
4. Add another function _matop_coordinates()_ that computes the coordinates of the min/max value
NB: Check your functions!

Hints:
* Represent the matrix as an array NxN
* You can use the empty file _test.c_!

Try to use the minimum number of operations and instructions (load/store, additions, comparisonsâ€¦)
